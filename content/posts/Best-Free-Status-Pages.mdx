Hello, in this blog post I will cover the best free(or free planned) status page / status monitoring tools, I will split these up into self hosted and SaaS(cloud) providers for ease of reading, and incase some people would rather self host. I will make a list of the features of all of them and at the end I will give my honest opinion of it. They are not in any particular order, so, here we go!

## 1: Uptime Robot (Free Plan) - SaaS

Uptime Robot is a very popular status and uptime monitoring service. For its free plan it gives a very generous 50 monitors. However, they only provide basic http and ping monitors on the free plan, which cut out most of it's advertised features. They provide a 5 min monitoring interval, which should be enough for most purposes, however may be too long for companies needing infrastructure monitoring. For notifications, they only allow very basic notification options like spelunk discord and some push notification apps for free. In terms of status pages, there is almost no customization, not allowing custom domains or subdomains only a / page, which is probably not very good for corprate use
