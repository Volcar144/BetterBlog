# Hello, and welcome to my first post

In this blog I will mostly go over some computing things, interesting things and recommendations. But first, I will introduce myself, I am Archie, a java developer, sysadmin and cybersecurity enthusiast, my main effort at the moment is my minecraft plugin: [Join Message Plus ](https://modrinth.com/plugin/jmp). Come here regularly if you expect to see some actual recommendations( not whatever pays the listicle company the most) and some random blog posts about tech. Enjoy!

P.s: Here is a cool rubik's cube player: 


<RubiksCube title="Rubik's Cube" algorithm="R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F' R R U' R' U'" setupAlgorithm="R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F' R R U' R' U'" autoplay={false} stickering="PLL" showControls={false} />
