# Hello, and welcome to my first post

In this blog I will mostly go over some computing things, interesting things and recommendations. But first, I will introduce myself, I am Archie, a java developer, sysadmin and cybersecurity enthusiast, my main effort at the moment is my minecraft plugin: [Join Message Plus ](https://modrinth.com/plugin/jmp). Come here regularly if you expect to see some actual recommendations( not whatever pays the listicle company the most) and some random blog posts about tech. Enjoy!
